00:04:26,590\nmeasurement makes the steel for our city\n\n75\n00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,090\nstronger than fits our cities together the\n\n76\n00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,090\nPurity and composition of what we eat.\n\n77\n00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,290\nWhat we drink and what we breathe all\n\n78\n00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,600\ndepends upon chemical measurement.\n\n79\n00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,690\nEvery day, we rely upon these measurements\n\n80\n00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,490\nto guide us through our lives without\n\n81\n00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,290\ngiving them much thought to the scientists.\n\n82\n00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,990\nHowever measurement is a constant search\n\n83\n00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,890\nfor the true value of what is being\n\n84\n00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,290\nmeasured.\n\n85\n00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,490\nHow do chemists accomplish this goal series\n\n86\n00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,800\ndemonstrator, Don Showalter.\n\n87\n00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,090\nMr.\n\n88\n00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,090\nAlways measuring things their goal is to\n\n89\n00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,390\nget as close to the true value of the\n\n90\n00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000\nmeasured quantities a possibly can.\n\n91\n00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,190\nWhat is the true value of the mass of this\n\n92\n00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,100\nantacid tablet?\n\n93\n00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,100\nLet's wait on this balance.\n\n94\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,900\nIt weighs 1.1 grams on this balance.\n\n95\n00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,390\nI have a second balance.\n\n96\n00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,490\nIt's a little bit more sensitive by more\n\n97\n00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,890\nsensitive.\n\n98\n00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,290\nI mean now that this balance weighed to the\n\n99\n00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700\nfirst decimal place to the 10th of a grant.\n\n100\n00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,890\nWhere's this one now weighs to the third\n\n101\n00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,090\ndecimal place to thousands of a gram or a\n\n102\n00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,400\nmilligram.\n\n103\n00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,300\nIt weighs 1.137 grams.\n\n104\n00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,490\nBut is this the true value of the mass of\n\n105\n00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,100\nthis tablet?\n\n106\n00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,100\nNow, this is an analytical balance.\n\n107\n00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,390\nIt's one that chemists commonly used to\n\n108\n00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,290\nmeasure small masses.\n\n109\n00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,000\nLet's see what it weighs on here.\n\n110\n00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,490\nThis should be the most sensitive\n\n111\n00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,000\nmeasurement.\n\n112\n00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300\nthe one closest to the True Value\n\n113\n00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,300\nit weighs 1.1362 grams.\n\n114\n00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,990\nBut I have a question for it.\n\n115\n00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,090\nHow do we know that this balance is giving\n\n116\n00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,990\nus an accurate measure of the mass the best\n\n117\n00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,300\ntablet.\n\n118\n00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,590\nActually, we can't be sure unless we've\n\n119\n00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800\nalready done an important step.\n\n120\n00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,590\nThis object is called a standard Mass.\n\n121\n00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,690\nIt might be tiny but it has a very\n\n122\n00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,890\nimportant function it weighs.\n\n123\n00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,300\nExactly one gram.\n\n124\n00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,090\nNow if this balance shows us that then\n\n125\n00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,490\nwe'll know.\n\n126\n00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,700\nIt's working properly.\n\n127\n00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,400\nas you can see it is\n\n128\n00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,890\nbut I have too far more basic questions for IT.\n\n129\n00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,290\nHow do we know of the mass of the standard\n\n130\n00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,500\nis exactly one Grant?\n\n131\n00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,090\nAnd how do we know what we are calling one\n\n132\n00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,190\ngram is the same measurement that everyone\n\n133\n00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400\nelse is calling one Grant.\n\n134\n00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,390\nPart of the answer rests in this safe\n\n135\n00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,990\nprotected by contact alarms and a special\n\n136\n00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,590\nglass container it sits in the sub basement\n\n137\n00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,790\nof a government agency near Washington DC.\n\n138\n00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,190\nThis is the standard kilogram the mass\n\n139\n00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,590\nstandard for all of the United States all\n\n140\n00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,290\nmeasurements of mass that are done in this\n\n141\n00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,990\ncountry start with the standard kilogram as\n\n142\n00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,700\na reference point.\n\n143\n00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,090\nThe National Bureau of Standards keeps the\n\n144\n00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,700\nkilogram here at its national headquarters.\n\n145\n00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,890\nThe chief concern of scientists at the\n\n146\n00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,390\nbureau is measurement they are devoted to\n\n147\n00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,390\ndesigning and testing new measurement\n\n148\n00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,190\nsystems then refining them to increase\n\n149\n00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,090\ntheir accuracy.\n\n150\n00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,990\nThey also maintain the standards for every\n\n151\n00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500\nother type of measurement that we do.\n\n152\n00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,700\nWhy are standards so important?\n\n153\n00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,690\nStanley raspberry is director of the\n\n154\n00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,490\nstandard reference materials division a\n\n155\n00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,790\nstandard in this case is an actual physical\n\n156\n00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,790\nembodiment of weight or mass and it can be\n\n157\n00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,890\nintercompared in different countries and in\n\n158\n00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,190\ndifferent places within the same country so\n\n159\n00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,290\nthat people always agree that this is a\n\n160\n00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,100\ngiven, Mass.\n\n161\n00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,290\nMost of analytical chemistry ties right\n\n162\n00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,690\ninto the kilogram because in analytical\n\n163\n00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,590\nchemistry the job of the analytical chemist\n\n164\n00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,690\nis to decide how much there is of specific\n\n165\n00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,290\nelements or specific molecules in a mass of\n\n166\n00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,800\na product.\n\n167\n00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,790\nBut long before chemists began using\n\n168\n00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,190\nstandards they were being used to ease\n\n169\n00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,890\ninternational trade and communication early\n\n170\n00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,590\nstandards weren't always practical.\n\n171\n00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,390\nFor example, the basic standard for\n\n172\n00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,500\nmeasuring length used to be the king's foot.\n\n173\n00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,290\nBut of course the king in Germany would\n\n174\n00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,990\nhave a different length of foot than the\n\n175\n00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,790\nking in France or the king in England or\n\n176\n00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,090\nthe king in Italy.\n\n177\n00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,590\nSo this could lead to very serious trade\n\n178\n00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,090\nproblems communication problems.\n\n179\n00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,390\nIt doesn't really matter too much what you\n\n180\n00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,600\ndefine a meter to be\n\n181\n00:09:04,400 -->

flask like this.\n\n297\n00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,790\nWe will then add water to dissolve the\n\n298\n00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,600\nsilver nitrate.\n\n299\n00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,090\nAnd finally

00:14:49,390\nAdd the standard solution very carefully in\n\n321\n00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,500\norder to perform an accurate measurement.\n\n322\n00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,090\nAs we add the standard

substance that\n\n328\n00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,790\ndetermines how sailing the Bay water is so\n\n329\n00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,390\nwe want to find out exactly how much of it\n\n330\n00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,200\nis dissolved in this sample.\n\n331\n00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,290\nNow see the pink color.\n\n332\n00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,790\nThis means that all the chloride in the\n\n333\n00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,790\nsample has reacted with the silver nitrate\n\n334\n00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,900\nin the standard solution.\n\n335\n00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,090\nWe have used 22.5 milliliters of standard\n\n336\n00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,600\nsolution.\n\n337\n00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,190\nEach milliliter contains 0.01 gram of\n\n338\n00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,990\nsilver nitrate.\n\n339\n00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,290\nThis means that 0.225 gram of silver\n\n340\n00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,690\nnitrate has reacted Now using this\n\n341\n00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,490\ninformation we can then calculate the exact\n\n342\n00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,900\nconcentration of chloride in the sample.\n\n343\n00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,090\nBut salinity

as\n\n366\n00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,790\nmuch as 100 kilograms of mercury every day\n\n367\n00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,190\nin response officials in Canada and the\n\n368\n00:17:09,200 -->

now allows only one\n\n371\n00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,790\nhalf of one part per million of mercury.\n\n372\n00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,790\nThis means that only one half of a\n\n373\n00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,090\nmilligram of mercury can be present per\n\n374\n00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100\nkilogram of water.\n\n375\n00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,790\nHow do chemists measure such small amounts\n\n376\n00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,490\nto find the concentration of a small amount\n\n377\n00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,090\nof a dissolved substance such as mercury we\n\n378\n00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,390\nuse a method called spectrophotometry. Now.\n\n379\n00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,890\nThis is a spectral photometer.\n\n380\n00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,490\nIt measures the amount of light that a\n\n381\n00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,890\nsubstance absorbs the measure that it gives\n\n382\n00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,290\nus is called absorbance.\n\n383\n00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,700\nLet's see how it works.\n\n384\n00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,390\nRemember when we were weighing the tablet\n\n385\n00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,690\nhow we used that standard gram to make sure\n\n386\n00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,090\nthat the balance was accurate.\n\n387\n00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,790\nWe should do the same thing when we make\n\n388\n00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,590\nour Mercury measurement using the spectrum\n\n389\n00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:57,900\nof odometer.\n\n390\n00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,990\nNow this is a blank solution.\n\n391\n00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,900\nIt has no mercury in it.\n\n392\n00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,000\nWhen we put it into the spectrophotometer.\n\n393\n00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,400\nIt should measure zero absorbance as it does.\n\n394\n00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,090\nThe Next Step involves something that we've\n\n395\n00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,790\ntalked about in an earlier part of the\n\n396\n00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,990\nprogram a standard solution now, this is a\n\n397\n00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,900\nstandard solution of Mercury.\n\n398\n00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,590\nWe put it into the spectrophotometer and\n\n399\n00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,900\nthis is the absorbance.\n\n400\n00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,590\nTo find the unknown concentration of\n\n401\n00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,790\nmercury in the sample.\n\n402\n00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,590\nWe will eventually need to compare its\n\n403\n00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,390\nabsorbance with the absorbances of\n\n404\n00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,290\ndifferent concentrations of the standard\n\n405\n00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,900\nsolution.\n\n406\n00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,890\nThe first step in that process is to\n\n407\n00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,990\nconstruct a graph matching the known\n\n408\n00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,090\nconcentrations of the standard solution\n\n409\n00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,390\nwith their absorbance measurements from the\n\n410\n00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,600\nspectrophotometer.\n\n411\n00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,490\nThe known concentration of the undiluted\n\n412\n00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,590\nstandard solution is plotted on the x-axis\n\n413\n00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,990\nand its absorbance in the spectrophotometer\n\n414\n00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,490\nis plotted on the y a point is placed where\n\n415\n00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,900\nthe two lines intersect.\n\n416\n00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100\nPoint isn't much used to its by itself.\n\n417\n00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,100\nHowever\n\n418\n00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,990\nEqually dilute our standard with a measured\n\n419\n00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,790\namount of water something interesting\n\n420\n00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800\nbegins to happen.\n\n421\n00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,090\nAdditional measurements are made on lower\n\n422\n00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,290\nand lower concentrations of the standard\n\n423\n00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,900\nsolution.\n\n424\n00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,400\nThe points form a line called a calibration curve.\n\n425\n00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,390\nNow we are ready to find the unknown\n\n426\n00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,190\nconcentration of the mercury in the sample.\n\n427\n00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,490\nBut first we need to get its reading from\n\n428\n00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,600\nthe spectrophotometry.\n\n429\n00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600\nSamples absorbance is plotted on the graph.\n\n430\n00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,590\nA line dropped from the calibration curve\n\n431\n00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,390\nto the x-axis gives us the unknown\n\n432\n00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600\nconcentration of mercury in the sample.\n\n433\n00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,090\nIn most experiments scientists perform\n\n434\n00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,390\nmeasurements at least three times and\n\n435\n00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,090\ncompute the average they do this because\n\n436\n00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,190\nrepeated measurements of the same sample\n\n437\n00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,990\nare never exactly the same.\n\n438\n00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,190\nThere's always a certain amount of error in\n\n439\n00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,890\nthe measurement procedure and in the\n\n440\n00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900\nmeasuring instrument.\n\n441\n00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,290\nWhen the same average is found using\n\n442\n00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,890\ndifferent procedures and instruments.\n\n443\n00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,790\nIt becomes accepted as the true value of\n\n444\n00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,100\nwhatever is being measured.\n\n445\n00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,490\nScientists try to make their measurements\n\n446\n00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,790\ncarefully to ensure that they are accurate\n\n447\n00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,490\na set of measurements is accurate if the\n\n448\n00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,600\naverage is close to the True Value.\n\n449\n00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,690\nIn addition to accuracy scientists also\n\n450\n00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,990\nstrive for Precision in their measurements\n\n451\n00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,790\nprecise measurements are those that are\n\n452\n00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,100\nclustered tightly together.\n\n453\n00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,290\nThe tighter the cluster the greater the\n\n454\n00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,700\nPrecision.\n\n455\n00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,190\nIt's possible for measurements to be\n\n456\n00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,500\nprecise and not accurate.\n\n457\n00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,690\nA tight precise cluster may have an average\n\n458\n00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,500\nthat's far from the True Value.\n\n459\n00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,190\nIt's also possible for measurements to be\n\n460\n00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,000\naccurate and not precise.\n\n461\n00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,190\nWidely, scattered imprecise measurements\n\n462\n00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,900\nmay still average out to the True Value.\n\n463\n00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,290\nBut imprecise measurements are a sign of\n\n464\n00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,490\nuncontrolled fluctuations in measuring\n\n465\n00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,990\ninstruments and procedures.\n\n466\n00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,490\nSo scientists.\n\n467\n00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,400\nTry to avoid them.\n\n468\n00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,890\nA scientist's goal is to obtain\n\n469\n00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,490\nmeasurements that are both precise and\n\n470\n00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,300\naccurate.\n\n471\n00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,990\nOut there, really then it says no new\n\n472\n00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,800\ncavities.\n\n473\n00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,690\nFluoride's first promotion today in our\n\n474\n00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,190\ntoothpaste and water we take fluoride for\n\n475\n00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,290\ngranted, but it took extremely accurate and\n\n476\n00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,590\nprecise measurements to discover how much\n\n477\n00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,000\nfluoride was beneficial.\n\n478\n00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,390\nTom Reeves is the national fluoride\n\n479\n00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,390\nengineer for the Public Health Service\n\n480\n00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,890\nPlantation has a very interesting and\n\n481\n00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,990\nintriguing history and it started way back\n\n482\n00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,890\nin the very early 1930s.\n\n483\n00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,390\nWhen a dentist went out to Colorado\n\n484\n00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,790\nSprings, Colorado to start his practice and\n\n485\n00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,490\nwhen he had a lot of the children come into\n\n486\n00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,490\nhis office, he noticed that they had a\n\n487\n00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,390\nbrown stain and he called that a Colorado\n\n488\n00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,290\nbrown stain the dentist Dr.\n\n489\n00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,590\nCharles McKay discovered something\n\n490\n00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,490\nfascinating about the children with\n\n491\n00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,490\nColorado brownstain, although their teeth\n\n492\n00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,390\nwere discolored.\n\n493\n00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,490\nThey had almost no cavities the case\n\n494\n00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,290\nexpected that something in the local water\n\n495\n00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,490\nsupply was responsible.\n\n496\n00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,790\nIt was fluoride but in very my new demands\n\n497\n00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,590\nwhen they finally determined that Floyd\n\n498\n00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,890\nchemicals was the material of his causing\n\n499\n00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,490\nthe brown staining they couldn't determine\n\n500\n00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,100\nand what levels the problem existed.\n\n501\n00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,490\nExample, was it one part per million? Was\n\n502\n00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,900\nit a hundred parts per million?\n\n503\n00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,990\nWas it a half apart for million and part of\n\n504\n00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,990\nthis problem was they could not measure it\n\n505\n00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,300\nat that lower levels?\n\n506\n00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,790\nIt took years to develop a technique that\n\n507\n00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,590\ncould accurately measure small\n\n508\n00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,190\nconcentrations of fluoride.\n\n509\n00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,890\nThen more research was needed to discover\n\n510\n00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,990\nthe proper amount to prevent cavities.\n\n511\n00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,190\nFinally.\n\n512\n00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,190\nThey identified it one part of fluoride for\n\n513\n00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,690\nevery Million Parts of drinking water here.\n\n514\n00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,190\nYou were that we had something in a very\n\n515\n00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,590\nfingertips that we could inexpensively add\n\n516\n00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,190\nor subtract to the drinking water and\n\n517\n00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,290\nvirtually wipe out or greatly reduce down\n\n518\n00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,500\ncarry them and was a really an astounding thing.\n\n519\n00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,590\nToday the fluoride in your water is closely\n\n520\n00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,190\nmonitored.\n\n521\n00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,190\nIf the concentration is too high the\n\n522\n00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,890\nColorado brown stain or fluorosis could\n\n523\n00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,590\nresult if the concentration is too low, you\n\n524\n00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,890\ncan get cavities.\n\n525\n00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,990\nI can't think of anything that more clearly\n\n526\n00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,890\nshows importance of measurement in the\n\n527\n00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,890\nfluoride measurement.\n\n528\n00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,690\nIt's the key to solving the mystery in the\n\n529\n00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,190\n1930s and it's also the key to getting an\n\n530\n00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,590\naccurate amount of fluid in the water today\n\n531\n00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,390\nso that you get the full dental benefits,\n\n532\n00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,690\nbut you don't get the problem of pleosis.\n\n533\n00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,990\nSo it's a very important measurement and\n\n534\n00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,590\nit's literally change the

matter\n\n543\n00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,700\nwhere you are.\n\n544\n00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,390\nIn order to make Chemical measurements a\n\n545\n00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,200\nvariety of techniques have been developed.\n\n546\n00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,190\nTimes the amount of a substance can be\n\n547\n00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200\nmeasured directly on a balance.\n\n548\n00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,890\nMore often one substance is dissolved in\n\n549\n00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,690\nanother it has to be measured indirectly\n\n550\n00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,890\nusing techniques like titration our health\n\n551\n00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,790\nand our livelihoods depend on the chemistry\n\n552\n00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,290\nof our environment and measurement is the\n\n553\n00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,690\nfoundation of our ability to understand\n\n554\n00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,390\nthat chemistry.\n\n555\n00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,390\nI'm in an analytical laboratory.\n\n556\n00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,590\nSomeone has brought here a sample of some\n\n557\n00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,390\ncopper ore to be analyzed.\n\n558\n00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,090\nNow that analysis has to be believed by\n\n559\n00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,190\neveryone when it leaves this laboratory.\n\n560\n00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,290\nThe chemists here have devised in elaborate\n\n561\n00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,390\nprocedure for doing it the analysis begins\n\n562\n00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,790\nwith a careful weighing of the sample of\n\n563\n00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,590\nthe ore then in this Hood.\n\n564\n00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,090\nIt's digested with a very precise volume of\n\n565\n00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100\nperchloric acid.\n\n566\n00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,000\nYou know when I think about it.\n\n567\n00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,190\nWhat this is is very much like a cookbook\n\n568\n00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,600\nrecipe.\n\n569\n00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,890\nAnd just in the same way that no one would\n\n570\n00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,490\nbuy a copy of a cookbook in which the\n\n571\n00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,490\nrecipes were not repeatable.\n\n572\n00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,290\nNo one is going to believe the analytical\n\n573\n00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,390\nchemist unless the prescription that he\n\n574\n00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,700\ngives for the analysis is repeatable not\n\n575\n00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,590\nhere, but just as easily in Dar es Salaam\n\n576\n00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,100\nor a novel severesk.\n\n577\n00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,590\nWhat we have discussed in this program is\n\n578\n00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600\nhow chemists determine what they have.\n\n579\n00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,390\nThe next logical question is to ask how did\n\n580\n00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,290\nit happen? Why these we will look at in the\n\n581\n00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,800\nnext program?\n\n582\n00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,900\nit\n\n583\n00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,300\nif you\n\n584\n00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:50,890\nfinding for this program was provided by\n\n585\n00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,590\nthe Annenberg cpb project.\n\n",
