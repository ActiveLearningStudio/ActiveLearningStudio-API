--> 00:05:28,290\nThey're told me that they're introduction\n\n89\n00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,090\nof the lithium battery to pacemakers was\n\n90\n00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,790\nmore significant than

component\n\n111\n00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,690\npurify it determinate structure and then it\n\n112\n00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,390\ngets handed over to the pharmaceutical\n\n113\n00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,690\npeople who decide how to package it.\n\n114\n00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,690\nI can believe it now, even if you're\n\n115\n00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,290\nfeeling just a little ill from a

--> 00:07:41,390\nreduce overall consumption of fat and that\n\n135\n00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,000\nwe carefully control the amount of\n\n136\n00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,690\nStraight molecules

00:10:32,400\nMelt the car down and make bottles out of it.\n\n187\n00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,990\nThere is neither created nor destroyed but\n\n188\n00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,490\nan industry we transform it every day in\n\n189\n00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,590\nthis plant the matter the petroleum raw\n\n190\n00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,800\nmaterial is being changed on a giant scale.\n\n191\n00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,790\nComing out of the plant are methane\n\n192\n00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,490\nethylene Steam and smoke and Flame, but\n\n193\n00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,090\nwhen everything is added up the mass coming\n\n194\n00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,200\nout will always equal the mass going in.\n\n195\n00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,890\nMost of our raw materials are drawn from\n\n196\n00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,890\nthe earth and that's where most of the\n\n197\n00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,790\nproducts and waste end up too.\n\n198\n00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,190\nThe great challenge now is to clean up the\n\n199\n00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,290\nmess we've made and reduce its production\n\n200\n00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,300\nin the future.\n\n201\n00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,490\nIn between input and output are the huge\n\n202\n00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,090\nfactories built to make those products we\n\n203\n00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,900\nknow so well.\n\n204\n00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,590\nEach of them comes from something and\n\n205\n00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,290\nsomething else.\n\n206\n00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,790\nThis must be added to that very accurately\n\n207\n00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,490\nand on a huge scale and this is where the\n\n208\n00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,200\ncaptains of industry work.\n\n209\n00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,690\nYou really have a huge network from the raw\n\n210\n00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,100\nmaterials which are primary petroleum.\n\n211\n00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,590\nTo the refinery situation, which is\n\n212\n00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,090\nprimarily the place in which you get\n\n213\n00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,000\nstarting materials.\n\n214\n00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,690\nThen those starting materials are then used\n\n215\n00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700\nto make Patrick chemicals.\n\n216\n00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,290\nThe petrochemicals then are used to make\n\n217\n00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,090\nall kinds of things from Plastics to\n\n218\n00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,400\nmedicines drugs to whatever.\n\n219\n00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,490\nI would guess that if you looked at it,\n\n220\n00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,190\nprobably 25 to 40 percent of the population\n\n221\n00:12:16,200 -->

00:12:55,800\nalerted that Eureka had in fact occurred.\n\n238\n00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,300\nAnd the competition knows it, too.\n\n239\n00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,290\nWhen our plant came on stream acrylic trial\n\n240\n00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,090\nwas selling for 28 cents a pound.\n\n241\n00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,790\nWe were making it for 14 cents a pound and\n\n242\n00:13:08,800 -->

started\n\n320\n00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,890\nWorking well, I succeeded it only took a\n\n321\n00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,890\ncouple of hours to work that day in March\n\n322\n00:17:21,900 -->
